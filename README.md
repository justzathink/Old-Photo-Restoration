## Requirements üîó
In this project, we aim to develop an AI-driven solution for photo restoration leveraging GFPGAN (Generative Facial Prior GAN). Photo restoration is a crucial task that involves reviving and enhancing old, damaged, or low-quality images, particularly for preserving memories, cultural heritage, or historical archives.
Details: <[Old_photo_restoration.pdf](doc/Old_photo_restoration.pdf)>

## Skills Acquired üöÄ
1. Model Fine-Tuning & Customization
Learned how to fine-tune a pre-trained model (GFP-GAN) for specific restoration tasks.
Modified code and dependencies to enhance the model‚Äôs ability to restore grayscale images.

2. Deep Learning Frameworks & Libraries
Gained experience working with PyTorch, BasicSR, and facexlib.
Understood how to install, manage, and modify dependencies to fit project needs.

3. Preprocessing & Data Handling
Implemented custom image uploading and processing pipelines.
Learned how to manage image datasets for restoration tasks.

4. Colab & GPU Acceleration
Leveraged Google Colab for running deep learning models efficiently.
Managed GPU resources to optimize inference speed.

5. Model Deployment & Usage
Understood how to download and use pre-trained models.
Modified and ran inference scripts to test real-world applications.

## Applications üéØ
Restoring old or damaged black-and-white photos by enhancing facial details and improving overall clarity.
Enhancing low-quality or degraded images for historical preservation.
Potential integration into applications for automatic image enhancement, such as mobile apps or online services.

## Conclusion üèÅ
Through this project, Our team developed a deeper understanding of deep learning-based image restoration. The hands-on experience with GFP-GAN, PyTorch, and image processing has prepared me for future work in AI-based image enhancement, computer vision, and model fine-tuning for real-world applications.
